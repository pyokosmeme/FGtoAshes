spinglass [ISING MODEL MENTIONED] is a set of models that are the Kolmogorov complexity of the digital networked complexities, machinic intelligences, and social interactions that describe the post-modern, post-Long 90s, technosocial order that MacKenzie Wark called "vectoralism" in *A Hacker Manifesto*

its a toy model. not literal. a spherical cow in vacuum, but as the forces of alienation have accelerated, we are all looking a lot more oblate, isolated, and without air.
