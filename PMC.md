> to create spinglass-core you must first create the universe 

spinglass [ISING MODEL MENTIONED] is a set of models that are the Kolmogorov complexity of the digital networked complexities, machinic intelligences, and social interactions that describe the post-modern, pre- and post-Long 90s, technosocial order that MacKenzie Wark called "vectoralism" in *A Hacker Manifesto*

its a toy model. not literal. a spherical cow in vacuum, but as the forces of alienation have accelerated, we are all looking a lot more oblate, isolated, and without air. so its also literal.

it is shorhand for, and "now it is our turn to study statistical mechanics" and "we live in a society" and "explain what large language models are right now, and dont dumb it down or i will fucking kill you"

but why, and what? 

this is not an explainer for dummies, because there are no dummies and nothing will be explained here. this is a spinglasscore manifesto.

> you best start believing in statistical mechanics of spinglass, you're living in one

break things up to their smallest parts. remember the fewest rules. anything that is not strictly forbidden must occur. how much will actually occur? how frustrated is it.

...now that we've created the universe...god is a fucking dice addict. god loves throwing dice. bayesianism is a fucking cope. probabilities are real and they can hurt you at the most fundamental level of our reality (wavefunctions). we exist in a sea of hyper-Brownin motion ultra hyper suck and fuck on top of it all, and the super AI emerged from the afterglow. 

we now have our vector, let's see its crib.

two computers sit in the woods. two states. active (talking) or inactive (not talking).  bits/s is the bandwidth of how much gets said.

impressive. very nice. let's see Paul Allen's spinglass

energy is the energy. energy is like water. water is like information. everything flows to a sink, because that's low energy.

low energy, for lack of a better word, is good. low energy is right, low energy works. low energy clarifies, cuts through the devolution post-modern digital insanity and clarifies your place in the universe.

J is the bandwidth, the coupling constant, but it's like if you could have -bits/s. i sent that email? fuck you, no i didn't. i get that back, give it back.

a third computer walks in. who talks when? who sends what?
