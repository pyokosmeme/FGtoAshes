# PSEUDO MANIC CRAP

> you best start believing in statistical mechanics of spinglass, you're living in one

imagine this was a serious substack essay.

**Spinglass models are a set of models from statistical physics that are the Kolmogorov complexity of the digital networked complexities, machinic intelligences, and social interactions that describe the post-modern, pre- and post-Long 90s, technosocial order that MacKenzie Wark called "vectoralism" in *A Hacker Manifesto.***

its a toy model. not literal. a spherical cow in vacuum. tho as the forces of alienation have accelerated, we are all looking a lot more oblate, isolated, and without air. so its also literal.

its shorhand for "and now it is our turn to study statistical mechanics" and "we live in a society" and "explain what large language models are right now, and dont dumb it down or i will fucking kill you." but its also not those things

its also a slimemold

what? why? and furthermore, what? 

this is not an explainer for dummies, because there are no dummies and nothing will be explained here. this is a spinglass-core manifesto.

> to create spinglass-core you must first create the universe

you are a physicist.

break things up to their smallest parts. remember the fewest rules. anything that is not strictly forbidden must occur. how much will actually occur? how frustrated is it.

...now that we've created the universe...god (us, the physicist) is a fucking dice addict. god loves throwing dice. bayesianism is a fucking cope. probabilities are real and they can hurt you at the most fundamental level of our reality (roll 5d6 for psychic damage to your wavefunctions). on top of it all, degen god and all, we exist in a sea of hyper-Brownian motion ultra hyper suck and fuck and the super AI emerged from the afterglow. 

we now have our vector, lets see its crib, lets see its latent space.

two computers sit in the woods. two states. active (talking) or inactive (not talking).  bits/s is the bandwidth of how much gets said.

E is the energy. E is like water. water is like information. everything flows to a sink, because that's low energy.

low E, for lack of a better word, is good. low E is right, low E works. low E clarifies, cuts through the devolution post-modern digital insanity and clarifies your place in the universe.

J is the bandwidth, the coupling constant, but its like if you could have -bits/s. i sent that email? fuck you, no i didn't. i get that back, give it back.

you have two states. up or down. you have a coupling constant. it can be any positive or negative number. Zeros and Ones. neodigitaltechnoculture.

ok, ahem, but its like talking. 

two computers talk in the woods, but how do they *feel* about it? are they aligned (↑↑)? are they frustrated (↑↓)? are they synched but hate the world (↓↓)? 

what is the exchange of information? is it low energy? high energy? is there friction? does it add value, does it spread the depression from one computer to the next?

its not clear because everything is static. Paul Allen's spinglass doesn't move, its just a .jpg. but god has a raging hard-on for dice, so he rolls the dice (but were god, rmember? a real Demiurge)

god jiggles the atoms. he lets the floaty toy bobble in the slosh-slosh of the hot tub. the spins can flip. they can bounce. what once was nice, can become frustrated. but low energy is good. nature flows to low energy. so while styems bounce and jostle and randomly move from state to state, they settle down. they're chasing that low E.

alignment is dynamic. alignment is inevitible. unless the temperature is too hot. then you're always frustrated.


a third computer walks in, and what can we get? your neighbors disagree with you? very frustrated. your neighbors agree with you, very aligned. one neighbor agrees, one disagrees? mildly frustrated
